# JavaScript: The Good Parts
Here you will find many examples shown in the book.  

Chapter one (Good Parts) is just an introduction without practical examples.  
Chapter two (Grammar) specifies the syntax of the language, so there are not many examples either.  

This repo contains examples from chapter three and so on, as well as some -ideally short and concrete- stuff I want to try out.  

Chapter three: Objects  
Chapter four: Functions  
Chapter five: Inheritance  
Chapter six: Arrays  
Chapter seven: Regular Expressions  
Chapter eight: Methods  
Chapter nine: Style  
Chapter ten: Beautiful Features
